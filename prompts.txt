Hello! I am a huge fan of ChatGPT. Thanks for your help in making me more efficient and teaching me to be a better programmer.

Could you please help me by generating the code for the following web site?

General Information:
1. I will copy the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data (if necessary) into seperate files.
2. The HTML will be in the main directory. The CSS will be in a subdirectory named "styles". The JavaScript will be in a subdirectory named "scripts". The data (if necessary) will be in a subdirectory named "data".
3. If necessary, there can be multiple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or data files.
4. At the start of each file please include the following as a comment in the code: "Assisted by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI." 
5. Please include necessary comments in the code.
6. Additional detailed descriptions outside of the code are helpful, but not necessary.
7. The website should be responsive so that it can be used on both mobile and larger devices.
8. The website will primarily be used on mobile devices in portrait orientation.
9. Please select colors that are subdued, but engaging.
10. Please use CSS variables for each of the colors.
11. Please select an appropriate font.
12. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Process Description:
1. There are two players that play the game: Player 1 and Player 2.
2. The player starts by clicking on one of the shapes in the staging area.
3. This shape should then be removed from the staging area and be displayed in the information window. The information window should also include the text: "Where on the board would you like to place this shape?" If the player clicks on another shape in the staging area than this will be added to the information window and the shape from the information window would be returned to its place in the staging area.
4. The player clicks on one of the cells in the playing field. The shape from the information window is moved to this cell and a highlight is added to distinguish it from the other shapes in the playing field. The shape is removed from the information window and a button is display that says "Confirm the correct placement of the shape". If the player selects a different cell in the playing field then the shape will be moved to this cell. It should not be possible to click on or select shapes from the staging area.
5. When the player clicks the button to confirm the correct placement of the shape, the highlight should be removed from the shape. 
6. The program should check to see if the player has won. A player wins when there is a row, column, or diagonal of four shapes that are either all the same shape or if all of the shapes are different from each other. If a player has won, then the information window will congratulate the player that won and display a "Play Again" button. If the player presses the button then the game resets by removing all shapes from the playing area and placing them in the starting positions in the staging area. The information window displays the original message.
7. If a player has not won, then the process repeats for the next player.
8. If all shapes have been added to the playing field and neither player has won, then the information window should display a message that they have tied and  and display a "Play Again" button. If the player presses the button then the game resets by removing all shapes from the playing area and placing them in the starting positions in the staging area. The information window displays the original message.
